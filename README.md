## History

After reading [How to pass pagination headers with Kaminari, Her and Grape?](http://aenain.github.io/2014/05/27/how-to-pass-pagination-headers-with-kaminari-her-and-grape.html) post by [Artur Hebda](http://aenain.github.io) I decided that it was a good idea to create a gem with his code.
